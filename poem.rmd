It was so simple: you came back to me  
And I was happy. Nothing seemed to matter    
But that. That you had gone away from me  
And lived for days with him—it didn’t matter.  
That I had been left to care for our old dog  
And house alone—couldn’t have mattered less!  
On all this, you and I and our happy dog  
Agreed. We slept. The world was worriless.  
  
I woke in the morning, brimming with old joys  
Till the fact-checker showed up, late, for work
